Description: Based on expression profiles, this Brammer web application could subtyping brain tumor patients with different immune infiltration signatures (i.e. C1/2 subtypes). The C1 subtype enriches for a constellation of protective markers for prognosis, such as high infiltration of CD8+ T cells and nature killer cells. The C2 subtype has an extensive infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and microglia, and was enriched with immune suppressive, wound healing and angiogenic signatures.
